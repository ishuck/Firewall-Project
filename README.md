## Overview  
A comprehensive enterprise firewall implementation project completed during a 2-week internship at Rana Application. The project focuses on advanced network segmentation, security policy implementation, and cyber threat protection for the HR and ACCOUNTING departments.  

### Project Objectives  
- Implement firewall technologies  
- Develop security policies  
- Deploy essential services  
- Monitor network traffic  
- Manage access controls

## Implementation Details 
## Security Policy Implementation
### Firewall Rules Script

The script for managing firewall rules is available here:
[firewall_rules.sh](firewall_rules.sh)


### Technologies Used  
- OpenSSH Server  
- Linux Web Server  
- Windows RDP  
- Virtual IP and Port Forwarding  
- IDS (Intrusion Detection System)  
- Antivirus Module  
- Web Filtering System  

### Key Features  
#### Network Segmentation  
- Strict separation between HR and ACCOUNTING networks  
- Controlled inter-department communication  
- Port-specific access (80, 8080, 9090)  

#### Security Policies  
- Zero-trust approach (no "any" rules)  
- Department-specific access controls  
- Application-based restrictions  
- Custom web filtering rules  

#### Security Modules  
- **Antivirus Integration**: Malware scanning, file download protection  
- **IDS Implementation**: Real-time threat detection, malicious traffic blocking  
- **Web Filtering**: Category-based filtering, custom block lists  

#### Service Configuration  
- **Remote Access**: SSH and RDP setup, virtual IP implementation  
- **Web Services**: Multi-port server deployment, traffic monitoring and access control
