## 🌟 Overview
A comprehensive enterprise firewall implementation project completed during a 2-week internship at Rana Application. This project demonstrates advanced network segmentation, security policy implementation, and cyber threat protection for HR and ACCOUNTING departments.

### Project Timeline

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Firewall Technology Implementation**
- **Security Policy Development**
- **Service Deployment**
- **Network Monitoring**
- **Access Control Management**

## 🏗️ Architecture
![Architecture](HrNetworks.png)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- OpenSSH Server
- Linux Web Server
- Windows RDP
- Virtual IP and Port Forwarding
- IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
- Antivirus Module
- Web Filtering System

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### Network Segmentation
- Strict separation between HR and ACCOUNTING networks
- Controlled inter-department communication
- Specific port access management (80, 8080, 9090)

### Security Policies
- Zero-trust approach (no "any" rules)
- Department-specific access controls
- Application-based restrictions
- Custom web filtering rules
## 🔒 Security Policy Implementation

### Firewall Rules Configuration

```python
# Example Python script for firewall rule management
class FirewallRule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, source, destination, port, protocol, action):
        rule = {
            'source': source,
            'destination': destination,
            'port': port,
            'protocol': protocol,
            'action': action
        }
        self.rules.append(rule)

# Example Usage
firewall = FirewallRule()

# HR to Accounting RDP Access
firewall.add_rule(
    source="192.168.1.0/24",      # HR Network
    destination="192.168.2.0/24",  # Accounting Network
    port=3389,                     # RDP Port
    protocol="TCP",
    action="ALLOW"
)

# Block Social Media for Accounting
firewall.add_rule(
    source="192.168.2.0/24",      # Accounting Network
    destination="*.facebook.com",  
    port=443,
    protocol="TCP",
    action="DENY"
)
### Service Configuration
1. Remote Access
   - SSH server deployment on Windows
   - RDP access configuration
   - Virtual IP implementation

2. Web Services
   - Multi-port web server deployment (80, 8080, 9090)
   - Access control policies
   - Traffic monitoring

### Security Modules
- **Antivirus Integration**
  - File download protection
  - Malware scanning

- **IDS Implementation**
  - Real-time threat detection
  - Malicious traffic blocking

- **Web Filtering**
  - Category-based filtering
  - Custom block lists
  - Department-specific rules
